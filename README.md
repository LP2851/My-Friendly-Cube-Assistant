# My-Friendly-Cube-Assistant
A simple program that started out as a Screen Saver and became a strange assisstant that can Google things (it just opens Google).

## Screen Saver
One of the scenes in this Unity project is the Screen saver. This is just me learning about Unity's physics and refamiliarising myself with Unity as a whole. 

## Assistant
The assistant was a more ambitious project that took a long time to get working as I wanted to create a good interface to make the rest of the project easier to build off of.
